## How Gendox Works

Gendox uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** technology to create intelligent AI agents:

### 1. Document Processing 📄
Your documents are processed using advanced NLP techniques:
- **Text Extraction**: Content is extracted while preserving structure
- **Intelligent Chunking**: Documents are split into meaningful sections
- **Vector Embeddings**: Text is converted to mathematical representations
- **Semantic Indexing**: Content is indexed for fast, relevant retrieval

### 2. AI Agent Training 🤖
Your AI agent is configured with:
- **Model Selection**: Choose from GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and more
- **Custom Instructions**: Define personality, tone, and behavior
- **Knowledge Base**: Your processed documents become the agent's knowledge
- **Context Management**: Relevant information is retrieved for each query

### 3. Intelligent Responses 💬
When users interact with your agent:
- **Query Analysis**: User questions are analyzed for intent and context
- **Semantic Search**: Relevant document sections are retrieved
- **Response Generation**: AI models generate contextual answers
- **Source Attribution**: Responses include references to source documents

    B --> E[Document Processing]
    B --> F[Vector Embeddings]
    B --> G[AI Model Integration]
```

1. **Upload your documents** (PDFs, Word docs, text files, markdown)
2. **Gendox processes them** into searchable knowledge using AI
3. **AI models use this knowledge** to answer questions accurately
4. **Users get intelligent responses** based on your specific content

## Use Cases & Examples

### 📞 **Customer Support Agent**
Transform your help documentation, FAQs, and support articles into an intelligent customer service agent that provides instant, accurate answers 24/7.

**Example**: A SaaS company uploads their API documentation, user guides, and troubleshooting articles to create an agent that helps developers integrate their platform.

### 📚 **Internal Knowledge Assistant** 
Turn your company's internal documentation, policies, and procedures into an AI assistant that helps employees find information quickly.

**Example**: An HR department creates an agent from employee handbooks, policies, and procedures to answer common HR questions instantly.

### 🎓 **Educational Tutor**
Create personalized tutoring agents from textbooks, course materials, and educational content.

**Example**: A university professor uploads course materials and creates an AI tutor that helps students understand complex concepts and answers questions outside office hours.
