   ```

5. Click **"Save Configuration"**

## Step 4: Upload Your Documents

Now it's time to give your AI agent knowledge by uploading documents.

### Prepare Your Documents

For best results, use documents that are:
- **Text-based PDFs** (not scanned images)
- **Well-formatted** with clear headings and structure
- **Relevant** to your use case
- **Up-to-date** information

### Upload Documents

2. **Drag and drop** your files or click **"Browse Files"**
3. Select your documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, or MD files)
4. Wait for upload to complete

### Document Processing

Gendox will automatically:
1. **Extract text** from your documents
2. **Split content** into meaningful sections
3. **Generate embeddings** for semantic search
4. **Index content** for fast retrieval

This process usually takes 1-3 minutes per document.

### Verify Processing

1. Go to **"Documents"** tab in your project
2. Check that all documents show **"Processed"** status
3. Click on a document to view its sections and content

## Step 5: Test Your AI Agent

Time to chat with your newly trained AI agent!

### Start a Conversation

1. Click **"Chat"** tab in your project
2. You'll see a chat interface with your AI agent
3. Start with a simple greeting: "Hello! What can you help me with?"

### Test Knowledge

Ask questions related to your documents:

**Examples:**
- "What is our refund policy?" (if you uploaded policy documents)
- "How do I install the software?" (if you uploaded installation guides)
- "What are the main features of this product?" (if you uploaded product documentation)

### Analyze Responses

Notice how your AI agent:
- âœ… **Provides accurate answers** based on your documents
- âœ… **Cites sources** by referencing specific document sections
- âœ… **Maintains context** throughout the conversation
- âœ… **Admits uncertainty** when information isn't in the documents

## Step 6: Customize Your Agent

Fine-tune your agent's behavior and appearance.

### Adjust AI Settings

1. Go to **"Settings"** â†’ **"AI Configuration"**
2. **Experiment with parameters**:
   - **Temperature**: 0.1 (more consistent) to 1.0 (more creative)
   - **Max Tokens**: Adjust response length
   - **System Instructions**: Refine personality and behavior

### Update Agent Instructions

Try different instruction styles:

**Professional Support Agent:**
```
You are a professional customer support representative. 
Always be polite, concise, and solution-oriented. 
Provide step-by-step instructions when helpful.
```

**Friendly Expert:**
```
You are a knowledgeable and friendly expert. Explain 
concepts clearly and use examples. Feel free to be 
conversational while remaining informative.
```

**Technical Assistant:**
```
You are a technical documentation assistant. Provide 
precise, detailed answers with code examples when 
applicable. Be thorough but organized.
```

### Test Changes

After each change:
1. Click **"Save Configuration"**
2. Test with the same questions in **"Chat"**
3. Compare responses to see the difference

## Step 7: Share and Deploy

Your AI agent is ready! Here are ways to share it:

### Internal Testing

1. **Invite Team Members**:
   - Go to **"Organization Settings"** â†’ **"Members"**
   - Click **"Invite User"** and enter email addresses
   - Assign roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer)

2. **Share Project Link**:
   - Copy the project URL from your browser
   - Share with team members who have accounts

### Public Deployment

1. **Website Widget**:
   ```html
   <!-- Add to your website -->
   <script src="https://app.gendox.dev/widget.js"></script>

       organizationId: 'your-org-id'
     });
   </script>
   ```

2. **API Integration**:
   ```javascript
   // Example API call
   const response = await fetch('https://app.gendox.dev/api/v1/chat', {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: {
