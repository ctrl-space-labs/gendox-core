# Gendox API

This guide provides an overview of the main objects within the Gendox platform and how the APIs are structured to interact with these entities.

## Overview

Gendox is a collaborative platform that enables users to work across multiple **Organizations**, each housing multiple **Projects**. A project comprises two primary components:

- **AI Agent**: An intelligent agent trained on project-specific documents.
- **Documents**: A collection of files and data sources that the AI Agent uses for training.

Projects can integrate with various external sources—such as S3 buckets, web pages, Git repositories, and FTP servers—to import documents. These integrations facilitate the seamless inclusion of data into projects, allowing AI Agents to be trained effectively.

## Main Objects

### Users

## API Associations

The APIs are structured around the relationships between these main objects:

- **User APIs**: Focus on user management across organizations.
- **Organization APIs**: Handle organizational data and user associations.
- **Project APIs**: Manage projects, including AI Agents and project members.
- **Document APIs**: Deal with document lifecycle within projects.
- **Integration APIs**: Facilitate connections to external data sources.
- **AI Agent APIs**: Oversee the training and deployment of AI Agents within projects.

Each API endpoint is designed to perform specific actions on these objects, enabling a modular and scalable approach to managing resources within Gendox.
